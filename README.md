# features_selection_module
This repository holds the source code of the module I coded for doing feature selection during data preprocessing. Through this module, you can do correlation matrix visualization, constant features selection, highly correlated features selection and features with no correlation with output. It's a valuable resource that I frequently rely on to make the process smoother and more efficient.
